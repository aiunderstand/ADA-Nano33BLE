# ADA-Nano33BLE

Please do not use this repository. This was hacked in a few days to enable hardware programming/debugging with a J-link device and a custom shield as pins are only exposed as test points. Several things are not implemented in this public repo such as ports 1.x, IMU, ADC. Have a look at the Microbit V2 version to see how they could be implemented. I aim to update this repo to a polished version and send a PR to the official ADA_Drivers_Library repo.
